# Privacy policy

This document describes the privacy policy that applies to all information collected or submitted when you install or use the Inter Planetary Flash Cards extension (referred to herein as "the extension", "IPFC", "us", "our", or "we"). The extension is an open source extension for multiple web browsers, owned and operated by an open source community.
Collection of information

## Philosophy

Privacy and user control over their own data is at the core to the IPFC philosophy. At the moment we provide users with a personal backup of their data, pinned on the IPFS (essentially hosted) for them on a third-party, unafiliated service pinata.cloud.

Later versions of IPFC aim to improve privacy and user ownership of their data by further leveraging the IPFS. Stay tuned for details.

## Collection of information

The extension saves application data like user's flashcards and highlights in browser local storage and on an external database. We do not share any of this information with any other companies or individuals. We do not collect usage metadata or any other data besides application specific data. User data is also backed up on an account created for the user at pinata.cloud and stored on the IPFS(Inter Planetary File System). This includes flashcards and highlights but no user information.

Besides application data, the user information (email) is stored on the external database along with a hashed version of the user's password.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.

## Contact information
